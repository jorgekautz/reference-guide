## What are design patterns?

There is one thing that is clear, no matter how specific a problem a software developer is facing is, there is a 99% chance that someone has already faced a similar problem in the past, which can be modeled from the same way.

Modeling refers to the structure of the classes that make up the solution to the problem that may already be invented, because you are solving a common problem that other people have already solved before. If the way to solve this problem can be extracted, explained and reused in multiple areas, then we are faced with a software design pattern.

## Why are design patterns useful?

It may seem silly, but if there is no use, things end up not being used. Design patterns are very useful for the following reasons:

### 1. Save you time

Anyone would love to find an ingenious solution to a problem when modeling computer system, that's normal, it happens to me too. Software development is an almost artistic process, and the mental challenge it entails reverts to enormous personal satisfaction once a good result is achieved.

But you have to be honest: always looking for a new solution to the same problems reduces the effectiveness of any developer, because you are wasting a lot of time in the process. Do not forget that software development is also engineering, and therefore in many cases there will be common rules to solve common problems.

Design patterns cut that point. Once they are known, they will be able to count on a set of well-proven rules and tools, which will allow the solution of most problems directly, without having to think about how valid they are, or if there may be a better alternative.

### 2. They help you to be sure of the validity of the code
