## What are design patterns?

There is one thing that is clear, no matter how specific a problem a software developer is facing is, there is a 99% chance that someone has already faced a similar problem in the past, which can be modeled from the same way.

Modeling refers to the structure of the classes that make up the solution to the problem that may already be invented, because you are solving a common problem that other people have already solved before. If the way to solve this problem can be extracted, explained and reused in multiple areas, then we are faced with a software design pattern.

## Why are design patterns useful?

It may seem silly, but if there is no use, things end up not being used. Design patterns are very useful for the following reasons:

### 1. Save you time

Anyone would love to find an ingenious solution to a problem when modeling computer system, that's normal, it happens to me too. Software development is an almost artistic process, and the mental challenge it entails reverts to enormous personal satisfaction once a good result is achieved.

But you have to be honest: always looking for a new solution to the same problems reduces the effectiveness of any developer, because you are wasting a lot of time in the process. Do not forget that software development is also engineering, and therefore in many cases there will be common rules to solve common problems.

Design patterns cut that point. Once they are known, they will be able to count on a set of well-proven rules and tools, which will allow the solution of most problems directly, without having to think about how valid they are, or if there may be a better alternative.

### 2. They help you to be sure of the validity of the code

A little related to the above, whenever something new is created, the question arises as to whether it is really coming up with the correct solution, or if there will really be a better answer. And this is a very reasonable doubt and that in many cases the answer is not the desired one: there is a more optimal solution, and valuable time has been lost in implementing something that, although it works, could have been better modeled.

Design patterns are structures that have been tested by millions of developers over many years, so if you choose the right pattern to model the problem, you can be sure that it will be one of the most valid solutions (if not the most) that can be found.

### 3. They establish a common language

All other reasons pale in front of this one. Modeling a code using patterns helps to explain to other people, regardless of whether they know the code or not, to understand how a problem has been tackled. It also helps other developers to understand what has been implemented, how and why, and also to quickly discover if that was the best solution or not.

But it also serves to sit down with other colleagues to think about how to solve something, and agree much faster, explain more easily what their ideas are and that the rest understand without any problem. The design patterns will help you and your team, ultimately, to move forward much faster, with a code that is easier for everyone to understand and much more robust.

## How do you identify which pattern fits a problem?

Unfortunately, there is bad news… This is the most difficult point, and the most obvious answer, which is also the one we like least, is that you learn by doing. Experience is the only valid way to become more adept at detecting where design patterns can help.

Of course, there are known situations in which one employer or another can help, and they will be discussed throughout the articles. It is also recommended that you read the Head First [Design Patterns](books/Head-First-Design-Patterns.pdf) book, in which, in addition to explaining the patterns in a very entertaining way, it explains very well how to use them in real life.
