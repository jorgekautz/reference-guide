## Factory Method pattern

*Factory Method* allows the creation of objects of a certain subtype through a *Factory* class. This is especially useful when we do not know, at design time, the subtype we are going to use or when we want to delegate the object creation logic to a *Factory* class. Using this pattern we can dynamically create instances through configuration, establishing which implementation to use in a text file, XML, properties or through any other strategy.
